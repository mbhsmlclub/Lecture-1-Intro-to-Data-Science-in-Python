This repo contains all of the materials associated with Week 1's lecture on Linear Regression.

We will show how to parse and manipulate data using Numpy and Pandas, and perform visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. We analyze a real dataset using Scipy, demonstrating how to perform basic statistical tasks in Python.
